            So, congrats on finding me!
            <p class="socenter">Welcome to my portfolio and as you've probably guessed by now, my name is Akshay Mantha. I recently finished my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, while minoring in Game Design.</p>

            <p class="socenter">My summer experiences have been on the QA side. I'm interested in becoming a front-end techie. Something that drives me is "good design" as I believe what looks good/easy-on-the-eyes will be easy to learn/adapt to. I try to learn anything in a manner, which would allow me to have a lifelong understanding of it.</p>

            <p class="socenter">My general interests include music (language doesn't matter, if the soul is pleased!), cuisines of the world, numbers, and racquet sports. I, also, enjoy painting/drawing, dancing, and Shakespearean works.</p>
